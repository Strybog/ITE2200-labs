## Design Patterns

### Composite design pattern

> Allows you to compose objects into a tree structure

- Both branches and leaves can be treated uniformly
- Try to break it down into simple _elements_ and _containers_ first.

- Scenarios where this pattern can be modelled include
  - computer's file system
  - organizational chart
  - family tree hierarchy
